libwpv
======

The library for formatting and parsing WPV data(suitable for binary payload).

WPV format
==========

WPV (Width Prefixed Values) data consists of WPV records, which looks like this:

<N1>DATA[N1]<N2>DATA[N2]\n

A length of a next field is specified between '<' and '>' symbols.
A length is a decimal number string that converted to a number by strtol().
After this a data is placed. After this a next field can be placed. And
in the end of a record newline character is placed.

Using
=====

At first, we need to create a wvp record struct:

struct wpvr *r;
r = wpv_rmake(0, 0, 0);

After this, we can add fields:

wpv_raddf(r, "Data", strlen("Data"));

Or parse a formatted record:

wpv_rparse(r, buf, size_of_buf);

After work, we must free allocated memory with wpv_rfree().

For details see examples.
